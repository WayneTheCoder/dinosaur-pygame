ABOUT

You are a dinosaur, and you have to dodge the meteors. If a meteor hits you, you loose a life. Hopefully, you always can eat a ham to recover some lifes.

I made this game to learn how to use pygame in my 2nd year of my studies, so it is not the best application I have done. It is not divided in modules, and the images are not the best. However, it was lost in my computer, so I uploaded it here in case someone wants to use it :)
