You are a dinosaur, and you have to dodge the meteors by moving the mouse. If a meteor hits you, you lose a life. Hopefully, you always can eat a ham to recover some lives.

I made this game to learn how to use `pygame` in my 2nd year of my studies. I recently updated it to support Python 3, and to polish a bit the project (mainly translating the comments and code into English).

I also left the original one in `first_version` folder just for the old times :D

## Local Development
You may need to [install some prerequisites](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) to make `pygame` work. Once they are installed, to install the project:
```
make install
```

To run the application:
```
make run
```

## Art
For the new version, I got the images from https://opengameart.org/:
