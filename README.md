ABOUT

You are a dinosaur, and you have to dodge the meteors by moving the mouse. If a meteor hits you, you loose a life. Hopefully, you always can eat a ham to recover some lifes.

I made this game to learn how to use pygame in my 2nd year of my studies. I recently updaed it a bit to support python3, and to polish a bit the project (mainly translating the comments and code into English).

I also left the original one in `first_version` folder just for the old times :D
